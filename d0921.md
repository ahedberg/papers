# Standard Library Compatibility Promises

For a sufficiently clever user, effectively any change we make to the standard
library will be a breaking change. In a few instances, we are clear about what
users are not allowed to do ("do not take the address of member functions of
standard types", "do not add new names into namespace std") - those restrictions
are not generally understood, are incomplete, and leave completely unclear
**why** those rules are in place. In keeping with general discussions of
compatibility, and as mentioned in P0684, I’d like us to be clear to users about
what does and does not constitute acceptable use of the C++ standard library.
What behaviors are off - limits to users in order to ensure that we have as much
flexibility as possible when making changes to future standard library
revisions?

What follows is an initial proposal for such a list of user restrictions,
largely drawn from P0684r0.I hope for three things from the committee:

*   LEWG and EWG will discuss and agree upon the contents of this list, and
    populate a new Standing Document with the result of that consensus.
*   LEWG and EWG will in the future ignore arguments predicated on, "But users
    could be depending on X!" for X on this list.
*   Committee members should work to disseminate the understanding of such an SD
    to the public - this only works in practice if the C++ community understands
    the trade-offs in question.

Note in particular that users of the standard are not special in this: abuse of
these rules is generally bad usage for any library.

## Rights the Standard Library Reserves for Itself

Primarily, the standard reserves the right to:

*   Add new names to namespace std
*   Add new member functions to types in namespace std
*   Add new overloads to existing functions
*   Add new default parameters to functions and templates
*   Change return-types of functions in compatible ways (void to anything,
    numeric types in a widening fashion, etc)
*   Make changes to existing interfaces in a fashion that will be backward
    compatible, if those interfaces are solely used to instantiate types and
    invoke functions. Implementation details (the primary name of a type, the
    implementation details for a function callable) may not be depended upon.

## Implications on User Code

As a result of the above reservations, users must be willing to invest
(potentially significant) effort when upgrading between versions of the standard
library if their code does any of the following:

*   Defines names in namespace std (or namespaces of libraries it does not
    own). Defining names in foreign namespaces is a break when a real API of
    that name is added. Preventing addition of new entries in libraries you
    depend on is counterproductive. Specializing library extension points such
    as `std::hash` with user-defined types is permitted.

*   Defines supplemental APIs for standard types. This is similar to the above;
    defining iostream operations, swap, etc for standard types that do not
    already support those can manifest as a build break, ODR violation, or
    behavioral change in the future if the standard defines those APIs for those
    types.

*   Uses `using namespace std` (or any using directive for sub-namespaces
    of std). This would also prevent introduction of new names in namespace std,
    because any addition to std can be a build break if the chosen name
    matches any existing name in that namespace. (This is especially
    troublesome with the global namespace and any C libraries.)

*   Forward-declares names from namespace std. Forward declarations require that
    the signature of that API does not change. Adding new default parameters to
    functions or new default template parameters to template definitions will be
    a build break.

*   Takes the address of functions or member functions in namespace std and/or
    depends on the signature of standard APIs. Well-behaved user code should
    assume only that it is callable as specified. Adding default parameters or
    new overloads will break code that does this.

*   Uses a deduction-guide inferred declaration of `std::function` initialized
    from a standard API. Eg: `std::function f = std::mt19937();` This may break
    in the same fashion as the above if overloads are added.

*   Depends on the absence of APIs via template metaprogramming methods or
    metaprogram properties of standard types (layout, size of, alignment of,
    triviality), except where specified by the standard.

*   Relies on [ADL](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl) when
    calling any function involving standard types, except for items on the list
    below. Unqualified lookup that relies upon ADL can be broken by the standard
    adding new APIs to std.

    *   Any operator (consider `operator<<` and `operator>>`, or `operator+` for
        string)
    *   swap (intentional in the design for swap)
    *   (Is there anything else we can think of that is expected to be called by
        user code via ADL?)


*   *Doesn't* rely on ADL for lookup on operators. The standard will not account
    for code calling `operator +("a"s, "b"s);` or `”a”s.operator +(“b”s)`.

*   Makes unqualified calls to functions in the global namespace when calling
    any function involving types from namespace std (or any namespace within
    std).

*   Contains user-defined types with oddly-defined defined copy and move
    operations. Specifically, if a user-defined type defines both copy and move
    operations, move must have the same post-conditions for the logical state of
    the target as copy does *and* be no less efficient than the copy.

    *   If the standard optimizes library operations or additional language
        rules to make better use of move, this should be good for everyone.
    *   If you define exotic types where move is less efficient or semantically
        different than copy, you will be broken by such changes.


*   Uses names beginning with leading underscores, as described in [lex.name].

*   Adds a nested namespace called "std" anywhere. There are numerous scenarios
    where future additions to namespace ::std would become ambiguous in the face
    of nested std.
